Exercise 1 - Types & Casting
----------------------------

Create a 32-bits unsigned variable.
Assign it the following value 270544960.

Create 4 8-bits unsigned variables.
Split the 32-bits variable in 4 slices and assign each slice to an 8-bit variable.

Print the variable values as Hexadecimal values.
Print the variable values as signed decimal values.
Print the variable values as unsigned decimal values.

Why do you think values between unsigned and signed print are the same?
